1. Click the button below to deploy the sample app to Render:

   [![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/stripe-samples/issuing-treasury)

2. Create a free Render account when prompted if you don't already have one
3. On the Blueprints screen, enter the following:
   - **Blueprint Name**: Enter any name (i.e. "Demo") 
   - **Branch**: Select `main`
   - **Under Key / Value**:
     - **NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY**: Your publishable test mode [API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) (starts with `pk_test_...`)
     - **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY**: Your secret test mode [API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) (starts with `sk_test_...`))

## Local development

You can also clone this repo and run it locally by following these steps:

### Dependency installation

Post cloning this repo, install the dependencies using:

    npm install

### Environment Variables File setup

Replicate `.env.local.example` as `.env.local` (in project root directory) using:

    cp .env.local.example .env.local

Update `.env.local` to reflect:

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY**: Your Stripe publishable key
- **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY**: Your Stripe private key
- **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**: For JWT encryption by NextAuth.js ([learn more](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_secret)). Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to obtain a new one
- **CONNECT_ONBOARDING_REDIRECT_URL**: Your application URL, for local use you can keep the default "<http://localhost:3000>"

### Database setup

On Mac, follow these instructions to install Postgres:

    brew install postgresql@14
    createuser -s postgres

You'll find more about the `createuser` step [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15309551).

Next, create the database with:

    npx prisma db push

If it errors out (perhaps due to permission issues), simply run the included script:

    ./db/setup-database.postgres.sh

This script creates a local Postgres `issuing_treasury` database.

### Application launch

After necessary setups, launch the application with `npm run dev`.

*Note: This application serves as an example and should not proceed to production deployment as it is.*

## Customizing your UI with the Devias Material UI theme

This sample uses the [free Devias UI kit](https://github.com/devias-io/material-kit-react) under an MIT license, which seamlessly integrates with Material UI and React.

You can easily customize aspects of the theme like the color palette by modifying the code in `/src/theme`.

To build a full-featured, production-ready application we recommend the [Devias Pro](https://material-kit-pro-react.devias.io/) version, which offers additional layouts, advanced React components, pre-built dashboards, and essential TypeScript support that ensures your code remains clean, robust, and scalable.
