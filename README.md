This repository contains sample code for integrating with Stripe's Banking-as-a-Service APIs, like [Issuing](https://stripe.com/docs/issuing) and [Treasury](https://stripe.com/docs/treasury). With one click, you can deploy these applications to your own environment to get up-and-running quickly, or reference the code while building your own integrations.

In this repository, you'll find the following sample applications:

* [embedded-finance](https://github.com/stripe-samples/issuing-treasury/tree/main/embedded-finance): Full-stack financial services for your business, with [Issuing](https://stripe.com/docs/issuing) and [Treasury](https://stripe.com/docs/treasury)
* [expense-management](https://github.com/stripe-samples/issuing-treasury/tree/main/expense-management): A commercial pre-funded card [Issuing](https://stripe.com/docs/issuing) program

You'll also find the source code for Stripe's [Banking-as-a-Service demo application](https://baas.stripe.dev). You can read and deploy that application, too, but it does not represent a typical integration, so we recommend looking at the other sample apps. They may be more appropriate for the financial product you're building.
